# SamplePOC

This repository has multiple POC codebase related to various implementations.

## Getting Started

The codes are not properly maintained but are fully working for the relevant scenarios.

### Prerequisites

Codebase might include python,C,OpenWRT/LEDE,Javascript,Node js, etc.

## Running the tests

To run the tests different environment and setup would be required for different code platforms.

### Break down into end to end tests

It is recommended to use all the codebase framework separately since each of them defines different use cases.

### And coding style tests

Coding style and programming language differs as per requirement of the POC implemented.

## Contributing

Contribution is welcome to take the various small POCs forward. For push/pull request kindly contact the owner.

## Versioning

Versioning will keep on changing as per POC requirement.
